// Browser-runner — the configuration (system prompt + toolsets + a spawn
// helper) for the disposable sub-agent that the do/get/check tools drive a tab
// with.
//
// The runner IS a subagent (peerd-runtime/subagent/spawn.js), spawned with:
//   - systemPromptOverride = RUNNER_PROMPT (+ a return-shaping suffix)
//   - tools                = a narrowed DOM-action toolset
//   - tabId                = the ONE tab it drives
// It returns a plain-text summary. The main agent never sees the accessibility
// tree, element refs, or the action trace — only that summary.
//
// THIS IS THE SECURITY BOUNDARY. Untrusted page text lives only in the runner's
// fresh, memory-less context. The runner has no memory tools, no egress tools,
// no code-exec, and no ability to spawn — so even a fully prompt-injected page
// can do nothing but mislead a throwaway agent that holds no secrets.
