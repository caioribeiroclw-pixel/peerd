# Changelog

All notable changes to peerd are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning is
**`0.MINOR.PATCH`** — minor = milestone, patch = fix, with
`store`/`preview`/`dev` channels as an orthogonal axis.

peerd is **0.x — experimental preview**: breaking changes are likely and
storage formats may move until the surface stabilizes.

## [Unreleased]

The staged integration of the open-PR backlog onto one verified branch
(the next milestone). Highlights:

### Added
- **PDF reading** (`read_pdf`) — pdf.js text-layer extraction in the
  offscreen document for born-digital PDFs; runner-only, output wrapped
  as untrusted web content.
- **On-device OCR for scanned PDFs** — render→recognize pipeline wired
  (Tesseract), `auto` escalates when a PDF looks scanned and the opt-in
  engine is installed. Fail-closed: falls back to the text layer until
  the driver is vendored and the asset SRIs are pinned.
- **Browser-native VM networking** — full HTTP, multi-host `git clone`,
  npm/pip/gem install via host-side resolution, response cache.
- **Session robustness** — auto-resume after a service-worker restart,
  per-message session store, provider failover chain.
- **Whole-extension type coverage** — `// @ts-check` across the
  extension (100% of eligible files), enforced by a coverage floor.
- **Verbose VM diagnostics** — `devMode` setting wires shell tracing
  into the WebVM bridge.

### Changed
- Service worker restructured into per-route modules with injected
  per-module state stores; handlers stay thin.
- README reordered to lead with install + project conventions; Tesseract
  / pdf.js / Gemma credited in the open-source list.

### Fixed
- Settings normalizer now persists the web-write confirm + robustness
  keys that were dropped during the route extraction.

## [0.1.5] — 2026-06-24

Sandbox, egress, and runner security hardening plus the e2e tier's
autonomous verify-loop and a docs pass. All code changes reviewed by
adversarial-swarm passes (security fixes held to a no-residual-bypass
bar) and verified green before merge.

### Fixed
- **Notebook realm seal now covers the Cache API** — the sealed worker
  also runs headless in the offscreen `js_run` host, whose CSP allows
  `https:`, so `connect-src 'none'` did not backstop there;
  `CacheStorage.{open,match,has,delete,keys}` are now sealed like the
  other network primitives, leaving no reachable network verb (#72).
- **Web-write "approve for this session" is scoped to the consented
  host** — the non-GET egress confirm named a specific host but cached
  the grant by tool key alone, so one approval became a blanket pass to
  any host; the grant key now folds in the host (#73).
- **Browser-runner prompt-injection hardening** — the disposable
  do/get/check runner's prompt now names the `<untrusted_web_content>`
  fence, calls out prompt injection as the attack vector, and adds an
  IGNORE → FLAG → EXCLUDE drill with anti-suppression language; 6
  contract tests lock in each invariant (#81).

### Added
- **Autonomous e2e verify loop** — `bun run e2e:verify` drives the real
  extension through every state on one Chrome (~6s), writing a screenshot
  per state + structured `result.json` (+ a diff image on a visual miss)
  an agent can self-drive; multi-turn / mode-toggle / vault-lock states
  added (#70, #77); the goal-state user-message assertion dropped in the
  consolidation was restored (#76). Per-run artifacts gitignored (#74).

### Changed
- Reader-facing docs de-jargoned — tighter voice, AI-isms removed.

---

## [0.1.4] — 2026-06-24

Goal-mode hardening, side-panel state fixes, an end-to-end test tier, and
provider default-model selection. All changes verified green and reviewed
by adversarial-swarm passes before merge.

### Added
- **Live-extension E2E tier** — a reusable raw-CDP harness with goal /
  stop / error scenarios (real chassis, model faked at the wire), wired
  into CI (#57); plus a local, npm-free visual-regression layer
  (self-contained PNG decode + pixel diff against committed baselines;
  deliberately out of blocking CI) (#64).
- **Provider-aware default models** + WebVM terminal fixes (#62).

### Fixed
- **Goal-mode autonomous loop** — durable Stop that reaches a
  vault-lock-paused run, resume sequencing, and cap-boundary correctness
  (#55); Goal bar / Stop rehydrate when a surface (re)connects mid-run
  (#59); goal-resume ordered before auto-resume on interactive unlock,
  with durable-Stop now awaited on steer / new-chat / archive (#63).
- **Spend-limit halt banner** persists across unrelated state pushes
  (Plan/Act toggle, `/system`, `/tools`, settings) instead of vanishing
  mid-halt (#54).

### Changed
- README embeds the demo video after the intro (#65).

## [0.1.0] — 2026

Initial **experimental preview** — the core buildout, integrated:

### Added
- **Providers** — Anthropic (streaming, adaptive extended thinking,
  prompt caching, retry), OpenRouter, keyless Ollama; opt-in local
  WebGPU inference (one proven model, Gemma-4-E2B).
- **Security (egress)** — passphrase + WebAuthn-PRF vault, idle
  auto-lock, `safeFetch` allowlist, denylist, audit log.
- **Sandboxes** — four execution kinds: WebVM (CheerpX), Notebook
  (sealed worker + OPFS), App (opaque-origin iframe), and the headless
  worker (`js_run`).
- **Agent runtime** — the agent loop and tool inventory (inspect,
  DOM/page via do/get/check, tabs, VM/Notebook/App, edit, subagents,
  memory, review, clock, web, skills), Plan/Act permissions, sessions,
  cost telemetry, voice (Moonshine + Web Speech), lineage-based context
  compaction, contacts.
- **The dweb** (`peerd-distributed`, preview channel only) — always-on
  P2P base network (mesh + DHT + gossip), did:key identity, signed
  content addressing, the dwapp bridge, and a peer-to-peer app store.
- **Distribution** — dual store/preview channels, generated manifests,
  CI gates (bun tests, strict typecheck, lint, dweb boundary, drift,
  in-browser CDP job, artifact matrix).
